# Personal Interests & Hobbies

## Cooking & Hosting

### Bostonian Beans Experience
One of my favorite hosting moments was curating a lunch spread called "Bostonian Beans" for friends visiting from Boston. I added a recipe a friend sent me on TikTok, baked my friend's favorite homemade bread, and picked up a croissant loaf from a bakery on their must-try list. There's something special about designing a menu around the people you care about—making it personal and sharing good food and company.

### Hosting Philosophy
Although I have less time these days, I love trying new recipes, hosting, and planning events whenever I can. While these gatherings are less frequent now, they remain some of my most fulfilling experiences. I believe in creating personalized experiences that show care and attention to the people I'm hosting.

## Pottery

### Recent Creative Journey
I recently started pottery and have been learning to make bowls, cups, and plates. I've been experimenting with different glazes and clay combinations, discovering how each one brings out unique textures and colors.

### Creative Process
I love the process of learning something new and figuring out how to improve over time. Pottery has also reminded me how important it is to have a creative outlet, something I had been missing in my life. It's been a fulfilling journey of exploration and growth.

### Notable Work
One of the cooler glazes I used made the raw clay and glaze look like a beach scene, creating a unique and beautiful effect that showcases the artistic possibilities of the medium.

## Learning New Skills

### Approach to New Hobbies
I'm always excited to try new things and learn new skills. Whether it's pottery, cooking, or any other creative pursuit, I approach each new hobby with enthusiasm and a willingness to learn from mistakes.

### Creative Outlet Importance
Having a creative outlet has become increasingly important to me. It provides balance to my technical work and allows me to express myself in different ways. Creative activities help me maintain a well-rounded approach to life and work.

## Community Involvement

### Building Connections
I enjoy connecting with others who share my interests, whether through cooking, pottery classes, or other community activities. These connections enrich my life and provide opportunities for learning and growth.

### Sharing Knowledge
I love sharing what I learn with others, whether it's teaching someone a new recipe, sharing pottery techniques, or simply enjoying good food and company together.

## Travel & Cultural Exploration

### International Experiences
When possible, I love exploring new places and cultures. My powerlifting competition in Korea was a perfect example of how travel can combine with my interests to create unique and memorable experiences.

### Cultural Learning
I believe in learning from different cultures and communities, whether through food, art, or other cultural practices. This openness to new experiences enriches my perspective and informs my work and personal life.

## Reading & Personal Development

### Reading Interests
I enjoy reading technical books, psychology texts, and personal development literature. This reading helps me grow both professionally and personally.

### Continuous Growth
I believe in the importance of continuous personal development, whether through reading, learning new skills, or engaging with new ideas and perspectives.

## Impact on Work & Life

### Balance and Perspective
My personal interests provide important balance to my technical work. They help me maintain creativity, reduce stress, and approach problems with fresh perspectives.

### Skill Transfer
Many of the skills I develop through hobbies—patience, attention to detail, creativity—transfer directly to my work as a software engineer.

### Community Building
My interest in hosting and connecting with others has helped me develop strong collaboration skills that are valuable in my professional life.
