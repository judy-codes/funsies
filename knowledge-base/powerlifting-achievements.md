# Powerlifting Journey & Achievements

## Powerlifting Career Overview
My passion for powerlifting began in high school and has steadily grown into a defining part of who I am. I wasn't a naturally strong or standout lifter when I started, but through eight years of consistent training, setbacks, and small wins, I've built both strength and confidence in the sport.

## Competition Experience
I've competed across different stages throughout my journey:

### Korea Iron Souls III Victory (February 2025)

- **Story**: I signed up on a whim during a trip, with no handler and only a day to recover after a 12-hour flight. Despite everything, I walked away with first place. That moment, standing on the platform in a foreign country, knowing I was neck-and-neck for best lifter, reminded me just how far I've come.
