          I believe that values are the compass that guide our actions, decisions, and relationships. This section exists because I think it's essential to regularly evaluate whether the things we do truly reflect the principles we stand by. For me, these values shape not just my work as an engineer, but also my approach to powerlifting, my personal life, and the connections I build with others.<br /><br />
          Whether it's taking on a challenging project, setting goals in the gym, or cultivating authentic relationships, I want to ensure that everything I do aligns with my core values. By constantly checking in with myself, I can stay grounded and focused on creating an environment where everyone thrives, pushing myself and others to grow, and ultimately making a positive environment to collaborate.
        </p>
        <p>My evolving values list is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Collaboration</li>
          <li>Growth &amp; Learning</li>
          <li>Inclusivity &amp; Accessibility</li>
          <li>Resilience</li>
          <li>Honesty &amp; Integrity</li>
        </ul>
